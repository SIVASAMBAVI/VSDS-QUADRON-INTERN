Installing the required programmes for this internship, such as Ubuntu on VMBox, Visual C++, and writing an example of C code along with evaluating RISC assembly code for the sample C code, are the tasks at hand.

Step 1. Setting up Ubuntu within VMBox
Once the tools have been installed, launch Ubuntu's terminal and enter the command.

Step 2. Order for Leafpad Installation
        $ sudo apt install leafpad

Step 3. To open Leafpad
        $ cd 
        $ leafpad filename.c &

Step 4. Order for Gathering and Examining the Results
        $ gcc filename.c
        $./a.out

Step 5. Command for RISC-V Compiler Code Compilation
        $ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o filename.o filename.c 
        $ ls filename.o -ltr

Step 6. Press to Display the Assembly Code
        $ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump-d filename.o ------>Provides a large amount of code
        $ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d filename.o | less ------->Provides Reduced Code /main and to see the code's primary function

Step 7. Order to Examine Assembly Code
         $ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o filename.o filename.c 
         $ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d filename.o | less /main
